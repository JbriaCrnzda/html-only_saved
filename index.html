            <p>Good works is not bad but if you think that it will save you from your sins then it is wrong.</p>
            <p>Good works are like <em>filthy rags</em> in the sight of a <strong>Holy God</strong> if you think that it will cover your sins.</p>
            <p><strong>!Important </strong> to know that we are <em>born sinners </em>, so really what good thing can come out of us?</p>
            <p>Can fresh water come from a salt spring? and can a salt water come from a fresh spring? <strong>Listen </strong>Good works will not save you and me from our sins</p>

            <h2>If you answered <em>Religious Deeds</em> Then you are wrong.</h2>
            <img src="./img/hand-holding-multiplication-symbol.jpg" alt="Hand holding multiplication symbol" width="220" height="220">
            <p>You attend mass, you say you did great things in the church. So you think you are saved from your sins because of what you did?</p>
            <p><strong>Salvation is by grace, it is a free gift from God</strong>, we don't deserve it but we need it and so we received it by faith not by our works or religious deeds</p>
            <p>You must attend daily to God not to mass and read the word of God (bible), obey the commandments of the Lord for a more personal and intimate relationship with Him and remember that <strong>for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourself, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Jesus Christ is the only way, the truth, and the life.</strong> Only way to salvation, only way to be saved from sins, only way to all our problems and cares from this world, only Him is all we need.</p>
            <p>He is the only truth from all the lies that we've been told, only truth that indeed He cares for us <strong>"Cast all your cares upon Him for He careth for you"</strong> He is the only truth that will not lie to you.</p>
            <p>He is the only life that we need, not this world or the pleasures or things that this world offers, they will only leaves us empty. We need true life, We need bright eyes and fullness of life and He offers it you right now. He is that life, the only life that we all need.</p>
            <p><strong>Jesus Christ saved us from our sins, He gave his life for us, suffers exceedingly for us, and died on the cross for us. But behold, on the third day He rose from the grave and is now sitting at the right hand of God!</strong></p>
            <p>Put your faith in Him just like a little child, trusting in what He did for you not what you did.</p>
